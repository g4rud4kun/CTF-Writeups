Yeah some of the teams had 600+ and 1300+ attempts.ðŸ˜‚
## Solution

This challenge is a continuation of the Tracem1 challenge. For better context, you can refer to my Tracem1 write-up. Unfortunately, I was only able to solve this challenge partially during the CTF duration ðŸ¥¹. I delved too deeply into analysis and missed a critical clue. However, Iâ€™ll share all the data and steps I took while solving it.
 
### Challenge Overview
We received a logs.json file for this challenge. Similar to Tracem1, I began analyzing the logs.

Here are some notable sites accessed in the logs.json file:
```yaml
detectportal.firefox.com
www.msftconnecttest.com
.
3.fedora.pool.ntp.org
0.arch.pool.ntp.org
globo.com
reg.ru
1.ubuntu.pool.ntp.org
politico.com
enable-javascript.com
mozilla.com
fb.me
20minutos.es
last.fm
xda-developers.com
unicef.org
nypost.com
target.com
kickstarter.com
2.arch.pool.ntp.org
.
gitlab.evil-insurance.corp
hr.evil-insurance.corp
files.evil-insurance.corp
meetings.evil-insurance.corp
it.evil-insurance.corp
evil-insurance.corp
chat.evil-insurance.corp
service.evil-insurance.corp
guestportal.evil-insurance.corp
sso.evil-insurance.corp
evil-insurance.corp
.
ubuntu.com
thepiratebay.org
generic-illicit-activities-hub.org
deloitte.com
bp0.blogger.com
```

These two sites seemed suspicious:

- thepiratebay.org
- generic-illicit-activities-hub.org

I then identified the user who accessed both sites:

```bash
$strings logs.json | grep -E "thepiratebay.org|generic-illicit-activities-hub.org"

```

### Suspicious User Identification

The suspicious user had the following attributes:

```
IP Address: 10.18.21.121
MAC Address: de:ad:be:ef:ca:fe (a spoofed address)
```

#### Activity Timeline of the Suspicious User

| Event                          | Time of the event             |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Req for the addr 10.18.21.121  | 2024-12-04 08:49:20.52        |
| Get assigned that addr         | 2024-12-04 08:49:21.00        |
| Access www.google.com          | 2024-12-04 08:49:34.58        |
| Access 2.arch.pool.ntp.org     | 2024-12-04 08:51:18.72        |
| Access thepiratebay.org        | 2024-12-04 08:51:51.12        |
| Access generic-illicit-activities-hub.org| 2024-12-04 09:05:01.12|
| Releases the IP addr           | 2024-12-04 09:22:01.12        |


This was another challenge in the Tracem series, so it wasnâ€™t going to be straightforward to solve via syslog logs. Additionally, the suspicious IP (10.18.21.121) didnâ€™t have any corresponding syslog logs, making direct identification of the user more difficult.

Since I had already established that the suspicious IP (10.18.21.121) was the only one to access the two suspicious sites (thepiratebay.org and generic-illicit-activities-hub.org), I decided to investigate further.

To narrow down potential leads, I began analyzing who else accessed 2.arch.pool.ntp.org.

I got these result:
```
10.50.103.29
10.66.91.95
10.66.68.75
10.17.161.10
10.34.192.28
10.65.26.90
10.65.68.160
10.51.64.145
10.66.156.255
10.35.126.228
10.67.252.116
10.17.6.47
10.50.184.143
10.18.21.121
10.49.220.32
10.49.79.62
10.49.65.21
10.17.90.14
10.17.26.247
10.17.171.253
10.65.228.127
```

### Initial Misstep
At this point, I noticed that the user accessed 2.arch.pool.ntp.org, a relatively common URL. I assumed it wasnâ€™t suspicious and did not cross-reference other IPs that accessed this site during the same timeframe. This was my critical oversight.

Feel free to skip the rest if you'd likeâ€”Iâ€™ll now share what I explored after this step.

### Investigation Details
#### Extraction and Analysis
1. MAC Addresses:

I extracted all MAC addresses to look for other spoofed addresses but found no results.

2. IP Segmentation:

I identified recurring IP ranges in the logs:

```
10.17.X.X
10.18.X.X
10.19.X.X
10.33.X.X
10.34.X.X
10.35.X.X
10.49.X.X
10.50.X.X
10.51.X.X
10.65.X.X
10.66.X.X
10.67.X.X
```

3. Syslog SSO Logs:

Only the following IP ranges appeared in syslog SSO logs:

```
10.17.X.X
10.19.X.X
10.33.X.X
10.35.X.X
10.49.X.X
10.51.X.X
10.65.X.X
10.67.X.X
```

So it was certain that I would get the username from this set of IPs.

Looking at these IPs, I thought this challenge might be based on Network Segmentation. It appeared that there were four buildings and three subnets, which Skat later confirmed on Discord.

4. Network Proximity Assumptions:

I hypothesized that the suspicious user might have moved laterally to a new subnet, maintaining the same host/octet structure.

From 10.17.X.X and 10.19.X.X:

- Likely Subnets: 10.17.21.xxx, 10.17.121.xxx, etc.
- Likely Hosts: 10.17.x.121.

Despite exploring these, I found no leads.

Then I moved on to checking the full logs.json file around the timeline of the IP guy. By this time, this challenge was my last one left, and I was very tired, so I couldnâ€™t search properly.

### Aftermath

After the CTF Competition, Jakob (discord) mentioned that I should have checked the IPs accessing 2.arch.pool.ntp.org around the timeline of the suspicious user (10.18.21.121).ðŸ˜¿

[Jakob's Tracem2 Writeup](https://team-bytesized.github.io/ctf/iris2025/writeups/tracem-2.html)

#### Key Table (from Jakob's Write-Up):

| Timestamp                  |              Events |                    Notes|
|----------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| 2024-12-04 08:45:33.555166 | 10.17.161.10 ( mhammond ) disconnects from network | releases 10.17.161.10 + pause in traffic from 10.17.161.10 |
| 2024-12-04 09:42:00.907257 | IP assignment to 10.17.161.10 ( mhammond ) | traffic from 10.17.161.10 continues |


This IP (10.17.161.10) was the closest to the suspicious user's timeline. The username associated with this IP was `mhammond`, making them the culprit.

Flag: 
```yaml
irisctf{mhammond}
```

## Reflection
This challenge reinforced the importance of checking all data points and avoiding assumptions during investigations. Despite missing the critical clue during the competition, I gained valuable insights and improved my analysis techniques.
Thanks `skat` for the cool challenges.
